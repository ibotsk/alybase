        appressed rays, without webbing between the rays, sometimes with fewer rays 
        on pedicels and sepals than on leaves. <b>Multicellular glands</b> absent. <b>Stems</b> 
        erect to ascending, simple or branched above, leafy, not or rarely spiny. 
        <b>Basal</b> and lowermost cauline petiolate, rosulate or not, simple, entire; 
        cauline leaves subsessile and cuneate to attenuate and not auriculate at 
        base, entire. <b>Racemes</b> several to many flowered, ebracteate throughout or 
        only basally, corymbose or lax, sometimes corymbs or panicles, slightly 
        elongated in fruit; rachis straight; fruiting pedicels ascending to divaricate, 
        persistent. <b>Sepals</b> ovate to oblong, free, deciduous, ascending to spreading, 
        equal or unequal, base of lateral pair saccate or not; petals white or rarely 
        pink, erect at base with flaring blade, longer than sepals; blade obovate 
        to spatulate, apex obtuse or truncate; claw slightly or strongly differentiated 
        from blade, shorter than sepals, glabrous, unappendaged, entire; stamens 6, 
        slightly exserted included, erect, slightly tetradynamous; filaments wingless, 
        toothless, unappendaged, free, glabrous; anthers ovate, minutely apiculate 
        or not; nectar glands 4, lateral, 1 on each side of lateral stamens, median 
        glands absent; ovules  4&ndash;8 per ovary; placentation parietal. <b>Fruit</b> dehiscent,

        transverse partitions between seeds; style 0.2&ndash;2.5 mm long, filiform, persistent; 
        stigma capitate, entire or slightly 2-lobed, the lobes not connivent, free,
